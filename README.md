# iplsetting
The Wii System Settings menu, extracted from the American version 4.3 of the Wii System Menu.

## Wait, it's all HTML?
Always has been

## How did you get those?
Well, I acquired a WAD for the Wii System Menu, extracted it using [ShowMiiWads](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/ShowMiiWads), extracted `00000001.app` using the same piece of software, extracted /html/US2/iplsetting.ash, used ShowMiiWads to uncompress every file from iplsetting. Keep in mind that you can only uncompress one file at once and that you have to manually do it for 758 files. It took me a few hours.

## Where are the other versions / countries?
They aren't here and there is no way I am doing this all over again.
